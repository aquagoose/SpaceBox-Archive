SpaceBox was a WIP voxel building game. As the project is now out of development (in its *current* form), I felt it was about time to publish it on GitHub. Feel free to browse the code as you wish. It's terrible, lol.

You can download and try SpaceBox by navigating to the [releases](https://github.com/ohtrobinson/SpaceBox/releases/latest) page. The game is available for both Linux and Windows.

Hopefully you 'enjoy' it!

### Launching
There are *a lot* of files in the directory. To open, you will want to look for `SpaceBox.exe` on Windows, or on Linux, just type `./SpaceBox` in a terminal.
